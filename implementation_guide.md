# Implementation Guide: Chudnovsky Algorithm in PenguinMod

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for implementing the Chudnovsky algorithm to calculate π (pi) in PenguinMod using the Infinity addon. The guide is designed for users of all experience levels.

## What is the Chudnovsky Algorithm?

The Chudnovsky algorithm is one of the most efficient methods for calculating π to high precision. It uses a rapidly converging series that can produce billions of digits of π with relatively few iterations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Access to PenguinMod (available at https://penguinmod.site/)
2. The Infinity addon installed in your PenguinMod environment (this addon handles large numbers and advanced mathematical operations)

## Step 1: Understanding the Variables

You'll need to create the following variables in your PenguinMod project:

| Variable | Purpose | Initial Value |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `pi` | Stores the final calculated value of π | (calculated at end) |
| `iterations` | Controls how many terms of the series to calculate | User input (start with 5) |
| `k` | Loop counter for the summation | 0 |
| `sum` | Accumulates the terms of the series | 0 |
| `term` | Stores each individual term of the series | (calculated in loop) |
| `numerator` | Stores the top part of the fraction in each term | (calculated in loop) |
| `denominator` | Stores the bottom part of the fraction in each term | (calculated in loop) |
| `C` | The constant value in the formula: 426880 × √10005 | 426880 * sqrt(10005) |

## Step 2: Using the Infinity Addon's Mathematical Functions

The Infinity addon provides several built-in blocks that make implementing the algorithm much easier:

| Mathematical Operation | PenguinMod Block | Example Usage |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Factorial | `factorial of [n]` | `factorial of [6]` gives 720 |
| Exponentiation | `[x] ^ [y]` | `[2] ^ [3]` gives 8 |
| Square Root | `sqrt of [x]` | `sqrt of [9]` gives 3 |
| Nth Root | `[n]th root of [x]` | `[3]th root of [27]` gives 3 |
| Logarithm | `log [base] of [x]` | `log [10] of [100]` gives 2 |
| Modulo | `[x] mod [y]` | `[7] mod [3]` gives 1 |

## Step 3: Main Algorithm Implementation - Detailed Breakdown

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to implement the Chudnovsky algorithm:

### 3.1 Initialize Constants and Variables

1. Create a new project in PenguinMod and add the Infinity addon
2. Create all the variables listed in Step 1
3. Set the constant `C` to 426880 * sqrt(10005)
4. Set `sum` to 0
5. Set `k` to 0

### 3.2 Get User Input

1. Ask the user how many iterations they want to calculate
2. Store this value in the `iterations` variable
3. For beginners, suggest starting with 5 iterations for testing

### 3.3 Implement the Main Loop

The core of the algorithm is a loop that calculates each term of the series and adds it to the sum:

1. Create a loop that repeats `iterations` times
2. Inside the loop:
   - Calculate the numerator: `((-1) ^ k) * (factorial of [6*k]) * (13591409 + 545140134*k)`
   - Calculate the denominator: `(factorial of [3*k]) * ((factorial of [k]) ^ 3) * (640320 ^ (3*k+3/2))`
   - Calculate the term: `numerator / denominator`
   - Add the term to the sum: `sum = sum + term`
   - Increment `k` by 1

### 3.4 Calculate the Final Result

After the loop completes:

1. Calculate π using the formula: `pi = C / (12 * sum)`
2. Display the calculated value of π

## Step 4: Creating a User-Friendly Interface

To make your project more interactive and user-friendly:

### 4.1 Visual Elements

1. Create a sprite with a mathematical theme (π symbol, calculator, etc.)
2. Design a clean background with instructions for users

### 4.2 Interactive Controls

1. Add a slider that allows users to select the number of iterations (from 1 to 20)
2. Create a clear "Calculate π" button to start the calculation
3. Add a reset button to clear results and start over

### 4.3 Display Elements

1. Create a text display area to show the calculated value of π
2. Add a progress indicator that updates during calculation
3. Include a comparison with the actual value of π for verification

## Step 5: Complete Code Example with Comments

```
# This is the main script for calculating π using the Chudnovsky algorithm

When green flag clicked
    # Initialize constants and variables
    Set [C] to (426880 * (sqrt of [10005]))    # Calculate the constant C
    Set [sum] to [0]                           # Initialize sum to zero
    
    # Get user input for number of iterations
    Ask [How many iterations? (5 recommended for testing)] and wait
    Set [iterations] to (answer)               # Store user's answer
    
    # Initialize loop counter
    Set [k] to [0]                             # Start with k = 0
    
    # Main calculation loop
    Repeat (iterations)
        # Calculate numerator of the current term
        Set [numerator] to (((-1) ^ [k]) * (factorial of [6*k]) * (13591409 + 545140134*k))
        
        # Calculate denominator of the current term
        Set [denominator] to ((factorial of [3*k]) * ((factorial of [k]) ^ [3]) * (640320 ^ [3*k+3/2]))
        
        # Calculate the current term
        Set [term] to ([numerator] / [denominator])
        
        # Add the term to our running sum
        Set [sum] to ([sum] + [term])
        
        # Increment the counter
        Change [k] by [1]
    End
    
    # Calculate the final value of π
    Set [pi] to ([C] / (12 * [sum]))
    
    # Display the result
    Say [Join [Pi = ] [pi]]
```

## Step 6: Testing and Verification

To ensure your implementation is correct:

### 6.1 Incremental Testing

1. Start with just 1 iteration and verify the calculation works
2. Increase to 5 iterations and check that the result is closer to π
3. Try 10 iterations to see further improvement in accuracy

### 6.2 Verification

Compare your result with the known value of π:
- π ≈ 3.14159265358979323846...

With the Infinity addon, you can use the comparison blocks to check how many digits are correct:

```
When [Check Accuracy] button clicked
    Set [correct_pi] to [3.14159265358979323846]    # Known value of π
    Set [digits_correct] to (count matching digits of [pi] and [correct_pi])
    Say [Join [Your calculation matches ] [digits_correct] [ digits of Pi!]]
```

## Step 7: Exporting and Sharing Your Project

When your implementation is complete and tested:

1. Click on the File menu in PenguinMod
2. Select "Save to your computer"
3. Save the file with a .pmp extension
4. Share your project with others who can import it into their PenguinMod environment

## Advanced Features for Further Exploration

Once you have a working implementation, consider these enhancements:

1. **Visual Representation**: Create a graphical representation that shows how the calculated value converges to π as iterations increase

2. **Digit Explorer**: Add functionality to display specific digits of π at any position

3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement the binary splitting technique to dramatically speed up calculations for large numbers of iterations

4. **Comparison Tool**: Add other π calculation methods (like Leibniz or Ramanujan) and compare their efficiency

5. **Educational Mode**: Add explanations about how the algorithm works and why it converges so quickly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Calculation takes too long | Too many iterations | Reduce the number of iterations or optimize your code |
| Result is inaccurate | Too few iterations | Increase the number of iterations |
| Overflow errors | Numbers too large | Make sure you're using the Infinity addon correctly |
| Blocks not working | Addon not installed | Verify the Infinity addon is properly installed |
